Core Gameplay
  Permadeath:
    When a player dies, they are kicked from the server for 5 minutes.
    After 5 minutes, they can rejoin and choose a save slot to continue.
  Save Slots:
    Each player has 3 save slots.
    On join, players must pick a save slot via a GUI.
    Each save slot stores independent progress (inventory, location, stats, etc.).
  Auto-save: Player progress is automatically saved every 60 seconds.
    Death Consequence: If a player dies while using a save slot:
    That save slot becomes locked.
    The player cannot use that slot until they manually reset it via the save slot GUI.
    Resetting a slot clears all previous progress on that slot.
  Classes:
    Players must pick a class via a GUI if none is assigned yet.
    22 unique classes, each providing slightly different attributes, effects, or actions.
    Example class differences:
    Health, speed, or strength modifiers
    Passive buffs (fire resistance, regeneration, night vision)
    Special actions (temporary flight, summon pets, extra loot drops)
Player Utilities
  TPA System: Players can request teleport to other players; requests must be accepted.
  RTP (Random Teleport): Teleports players to a random location within the world.
  Homes:
    Players can set up to 5 homes.
    Home GUI Players can set, unset, or teleport to homes.
    Each home can be named for easy identification.
    Maximum of 5 homes per player.
